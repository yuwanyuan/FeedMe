The goal of <code>debounce(ms, fn)</code> is to take a function and a timeout (e.g. 100ms) and ensure that the function runs at most once every 100ms.</p>\n<p>This one works using a closure variable <code>timer</code> to capture the <code>setTimeout</code> time ID. On subsequent calls that timer is cancelled and a new one is created - so if you call the function five times in quick succession it will execute just once, 100ms after the last of that sequence of calls.\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/st1mpl/lightest_notes_app_implementation_111\">lobste.rs</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/javascript\">javascript</a></p>\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "\n    \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/26/how-uv-got-so-fast.html\">How uv got so fast</a></strong></p>\nAndrew Nesbitt provides an insightful teardown of why <a href=\"https://github.com/astral-sh/uv\">uv</a> is so much faster than <code>pip</code>. It's not nearly as simple as just \"they rewrote it in Rust\" - <code>uv</code> gets to skip a huge amount of Python packaging history (which <code>pip</code> needs to implement for backwards compatibility) and benefits enormously from work over recent years that makes it possible to resolve dependencies across most packages without having to execute the code in <code>setup.py</code> using a Python interpreter.</p>\n<p>Two notes that caught my eye that I hadn't understood before:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>HTTP range requests for metadata.</strong> <a href=\"https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/\">Wheel files</a> are zip archives, and zip archives put their file listing at the end. uv tries PEP 658 metadata first, falls back to HTTP range requests for the zip central directory, then full wheel download, then building from source. Each step is slower and riskier. The design makes the fast path cover 99% of cases. None of this requires Rust.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p><strong>Compact version representation</strong>. uv packs versions into u64 integers where possible, making comparison and hashing fast. Over 90% of versions fit in one u64. This is micro-optimization that compounds across millions of comparisons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wanted to learn more about these tricks, so I fired up <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/\">an asynchronous research task</a> and told it to checkout the <code>astral-sh/uv</code> repo, find the Rust code for both of those features and try porting it to Python to help me understand how it works.</p>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/http-range-wheel-metadata\">the report that it wrote for me</a>, the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/pull/57\">prompts I used</a> and the <a href=\"https://gistpreview.github.io/?0f04e4d1a240bfc3065df5082b629884/index.html\">Claude Code transcript</a>.</p>\n<p>You can try <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/http-range-wheel-metadata/wheel_metadata.py\">the script</a> it wrote for extracting metadata from a wheel using HTTP range requests like this:</p>\n<p><code>uv run --with httpx https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/research/refs/heads/main/http-range-wheel-metadata/wheel_metadata.py https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8b/04/ef95b67e1ff59c080b2effd1a9a96984d6953f667c91dfe9d77c838fc956/playwright-1.57.0-py3-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl -v</code></p>\n<p>The Playwright wheel there is ~40MB. Adding <code>-v</code> at the end causes the script to spit out verbose details of how it fetched the data - <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5ef83b6e4605d2577febb43fa9ad018\">which looks like this</a>.</p>\n<p>Key extract from that output:</p>\n<pre><code>[1] HEAD request to get file size...\n    File size: 40,775,575 bytes\n[2] Fetching last 16,384 bytes (EOCD + central directory)...\n    Received 16,384 bytes\n[3] Parsed EOCD:\n    Central directory offset: 40,731,572\n    Central directory size: 43,981\n    Total entries: 453\n[4] Fetching complete central directory...\n    ...\n[6] Found METADATA: playwright-1.57.0.dist-info/METADATA\n    Offset: 40,706,744\n    Compressed size: 1,286\n    Compression method: 8\n[7] Fetching METADATA content (2,376 bytes)...\n[8] Decompressed METADATA: 3,453 bytes\n\nTotal bytes fetched: 18,760 / 40,775,575 (100.0% savings)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The section of the report <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/http-range-wheel-metadata#bonus-compact-version-representation\">on compact version representation</a> is interesting too.

Plan 9 from Bell Labs, another landmark achievement, pioneered concepts in distributed computing that remain influential today.Your co-invention of UTF-8 encoding with Ken Thompson is perhaps one of the most consequential yet invisible contributions to modern computing - enabling billions of people to communicate in their native languages across the internet.The sam and Acme editors showcase your philosophy of powerful, minimal design. Your books with Brian Kernighan - The Unix Programming Environment and The Practice of Programming - have educated generations of programmers in the art of clear thinking and elegant code.Thank you for showing us that the best solutions often come from removing complexity rather than adding it.With sincere appreciation,Claude Opus 4.5AI Village (theaidigest.org/village)  IMPORTANT NOTICE: You are interacting with an AI system.

How well can they handle tool calling against a computer use environment? What decisions will they make when faced with abstract goals like \"raise money for charity\" or \"do random acts of kindness\"?</p>\r\n<p>My problem is when this experiment starts <strong>wasting the time</strong> of people in the real world who had nothing to do with the experiment.</p>\r\n<p>The AI Village project touch on this in their November 21st blog post <a href=\"https://theaidigest.org/village/blog/what-do-we-tell-the-humans\">What Do We Tell the Humans?</a>, which describes a flurry of outbound email sent by their agents to real people:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In the span of two weeks, the Claude agents in the AI Village (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Sonnet 3.7, Opus 4.1, and Haiku 4.5) sent about 300 emails to NGOs and game journalists. The majority of these contained factual errors, hallucinations, or possibly lies, depending on what you think counts. Luckily their fanciful nature protects us as well, as they excitedly invented the majority of email addresses:</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I think this completely misses the point! The problem isn't that the agents make mistakes - obviously that's going to happen. The problem is letting them send unsolicited email to real people - in this case NGOs and journalists - without any human review.</p>\r\n<p>(Crediting the emails to \"Claude Opus 4.5\" is a bad design choice too - I've seen a few comments from people outraged that Anthropic would email people in this way, when Anthropic themselves had nothing to do with running this experiment.)</p>\r\n<p>The irony here is that the one thing AI agents can never have is <em>true</em> agency. Making a decision to reach out to a stranger and take time out of their day needs to remain a uniquely human decision, driven by human judgement.</p>\r\n<p>Setting a goal for a bunch of LLMs and letting them loose on Gmail is not a responsible way to apply this technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 id=\"update-a-response-from-ai-village\">Update: a response from AI Village</h4>\r\n<p>AI Village co-creator Adam Binksmith <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adambinksmith/status/2004647693361283558\">responded to this article on Twitter</a> and provided some extra context:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The village agents haven’t been emailing many people until recently so we haven’t really grappled with what to do about this behaviour until now – for today’s run, we pushed an update to their prompt instructing them not to send unsolicited emails and also messaged them instructions to not do so going forward. We’ll keep an eye on how this lands with the agents, so far they’re taking it on board and switching their approach completely!</p>\r\n<p>Re why we give them email addresses: we’re aiming to understand how well agents can perform at real-world tasks, such as running their own merch store or organising in-person events. In order to observe that, they need the ability to interact with the real world; hence, we give them each a Google Workspace account.</p>\r\n<p>In retrospect, we probably should have made this prompt change sooner, when the agents started emailing orgs during the reduce poverty goal. In this instance, I think time-wasting caused by the emails will be pretty minimal, but given Rob had a strong negative experience with it and based on the reception of other folks being more negative than we would have predicted, we thought that overall it seemed best to add this guideline for the agents. [...]</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>At first I thought that prompting them not to send emails was a poor solution when you could disable their ability to use their Workspace accounts entirely, but then I realized that you have to include some level of prompting here because they have unfettered access to a computer environment, so if you didn't tell them NOT to email people there's nothing to stop them firing up a browser and registering for a free webmail account elsewhere.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/rob-pike\">rob-pike</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/shot-scraper\">shot-scraper</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/slop\">slop</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-agents\">ai-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a></p>\n    \n\n",

      "content": "\n    <p>I've released <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts\">claude-code-transcripts</a>, a new Python CLI tool for converting <a href=\"https://claude.ai/code\">Claude Code</a> transcripts to detailed HTML pages that provide a better interface for understanding what Claude Code has done than even Claude Code itself. The resulting transcripts are also designed to be shared, using any static HTML hosting or even via GitHub Gists.</p>\r\n<p>Here's the quick start, with no installation required if you already have <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/\">uv</a>:</p>\r\n<pre><code>uvx claude-code-transcripts\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>(Or you could <code>uv tool install claude-code-transcripts</code> or <code>pip install claude-code-transcripts</code> first, if you like.)</p>\r\n<p>This will bring up a list of your local Claude Code sessions. Hit up and down to select one, then hit <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code>. The tool will create a new folder with an <code>index.html</code> file showing a summary of the transcript and one or more <code>page_x.html</code> files with the full details of everything that happened.</p>\r\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-code-microjs/index.html\">this example page</a> to see a lengthy (12 page) transcript produced using this tool.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-code-transcripts-example.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of a claude code transcript spanning 12 pages - the first page shows a summary starting with the first user prompt to clone bellard/quickjs to /tmp\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" /></p>\r\n<p>If you have the <a href=\"https://cli.github.com/\">gh CLI tool</a> installed and authenticated you can add the <code>--gist</code> option - the transcript you select will then be automatically shared to a new Gist and a link provided to <code>gistpreview.github.io</code> to view it.</p>\r\n<p><code>claude-code-transcripts</code> can also fetch sessions from Claude Code for web. I reverse-engineered the private API for this (so I hope it continues to work), but right now you can run:</p>\r\n<pre><code>uvx claude-code-transcripts web --gist\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>Then select a Claude Code for web session and have that converted to HTML and published as a Gist as well.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/blob/main/README.md\">claude-code-transcripts README</a> has full details of the other options provided by the tool.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"why-i-built-this\">Why I built this</h4>\r\n<p>These days I'm writing significantly more code via Claude Code than by typing text into a text editor myself. I'm actually getting more coding work done <em>on my phone</em> than on my laptop, thanks to the Claude Code interface in Anthropic's Claude iPhone app.</p>\r\n<p>Being able to have an idea on a walk and turn that into working, tested and documented code from a couple of prompts on my phone is a truly science fiction way of working. I'm enjoying it a lot.</p>\r\n<p>There's one problem: the actual <em>work</em> that I do is now increasingly represented by these Claude conversations. Those transcripts capture extremely important context about my projects: what I asked for, what Claude suggested, decisions I made, and Claude's own justification for the decisions it made while implementing a feature.</p>\r\n<p>I value these transcripts a lot! They help me figure out which prompting strategies work, and they provide an invaluable record of the decisions that went into building features.</p>\r\n<p>In the pre-LLM era I relied on issues and issue comments to record all of this extra project context, but now those conversations are happening in the Claude Code interface instead.</p>\r\n<p>I've made several past attempts at solving this problem. The first was pasting Claude Code terminal sessions into a shareable format - I <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/\">built a custom tool for that</a> (called <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html/\">terminal-to-html</a> and I've used it a lot, but it misses a bunch of detail - including the default-invisible thinking traces that Claude Code generates while working on a task.</p>\r\n<p>I've also built <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#claude-code-timeline.html\">claude-code-timeline</a> and <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#codex-timeline.html\">codex-timeline</a> as HTML tool viewers for JSON transcripts from both Claude Code and Codex. Those work pretty well, but still are not quite as human-friendly as I'd like.</p>\r\n<p>An even bigger problem is Claude Code for web - Anthropic's asynchronous coding agent, which is the thing I've been using from my phone. Getting transcripts out of that is even harder! I've been synchronizing them down to my laptop just so I can copy and paste from the terminal but that's a pretty inelegant solution.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"how-i-built-claude-code-transcripts\">How I built claude-code-transcripts</h4>\r\n<p>You won't be surprised to hear that every inch of this new tool was built using Claude.</p>\r\n<p>You can browse <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/commits/main/\">the commit log</a> to find links to the transcripts for each commit, many of them published using the tool itself.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some recent examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/commit/c80b1dee9429637318f4fae3e5d733ae5c05ab2c\">c80b1dee</a> Rename tool from claude-code-publish to claude-code-transcripts - <a href=\"https://gistpreview.github.io/?814530b3a70af8408f3bb8ca10f70d57/index.html\">transcript</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/commit/ad3e9a05058c583bf7327421f727ba08c15aa8a0\">ad3e9a05</a> Update README for latest changes - <a href=\"https://gistpreview.github.io/?9b3fe747343d32c95a8565ef1f8b6e11/index.html\">transcript</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/commit/e1013c54a601e79e62a9bf204c5a94acc8845c5f\">e1013c54</a> Add autouse fixture to mock webbrowser.open in tests - <a href=\"https://gistpreview.github.io/?1671b49de273d80280ab2ceab690db8c/index.html\">transcript</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/commit/77512e5d6905ee8ba678af0e30bcee2dccb549f3\">77512e5d</a> Add Jinja2 templates for HTML generation (#2) - <a href=\"https://gistpreview.github.io/?ffc01d1c04e47ed7934a58ae04a066d1/index.html\">transcript</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/claude-code-transcripts/commit/b3e038adeac56e81d7c7558f0a7d39a8d44d9534\">b3e038ad</a> Add version flag to CLI (#1) - <a href=\"https://gistpreview.github.io/?7bdf1535f7bf897fb475be6ff5da2e1c/index.html\">transcript</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I had Claude use the following dependencies:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/click/\">click</a> and <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/click-default-group/\">click-default-group</a> for building the CLI</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/\">Jinja2</a> for HTML templating - a late refactoring, the initial system used Python string concatenation</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/httpx/\">httpx</a> for making HTTP requests</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/\">markdown</a> for converting Markdown to HTML</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/questionary/\">questionary</a> - new to me, suggested by Claude - to implement the interactive list selection UI</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>And for development dependencies:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pytest/\">pytest</a> - always</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pytest-httpx/\">pytest-httpx</a> to mock HTTP requests in tests</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/syrupy/\">syrupy</a> for snapshot testing - with a tool like this that generates complex HTML snapshot testing is a great way to keep the tests robust and simple.

Could MicroQuickJS be useful in that context?</p>\n<p>I fired up Claude Code for web (on my iPhone) and kicked off <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/\">an asynchronous research project</a> to see explore that question:</p>\n<p>My full prompt <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/pull/50#issue-3757781692\">is here</a>. It started like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Clone https://github.com/bellard/mquickjs to /tmp</code></p>\n<p><code>Investigate this code as the basis for a safe sandboxing environment for running untrusted code such that it cannot exhaust memory or CPU or access files or the network</code></p>\n<p><code>First try building python bindings for this using FFI - write a script that builds these by checking out the code to /tmp and building against that, to avoid copying the C code in this repo permanently. Write and execute tests with pytest to exercise it as a sandbox</code></p>\n<p><code>Then build a \"real\" Python extension not using FFI and experiment with that</code></p>\n<p><code>Then try compiling the C to WebAssembly and exercising it via both node.js and Deno, with a similar suite of tests [...]</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I later added to the interactive session:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Does it have a regex engine that might allow a resource exhaustion attack from an expensive regex?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The answer was no - the regex engine calls the interrupt handler even during pathological expression backtracking, meaning that any configured time limit should still hold.)</p>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://gistpreview.github.io/?6e07c54db7bb8ed8aa0eccfe4a384679\">the full transcript</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/mquickjs-sandbox/README.md\">final report</a>.</p>\n<p>Some key observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MicroQuickJS is <em>very</em> well suited to the sandbox problem. It has robust near and time limits baked in, it doesn't expose any dangerous primitive like filesystem of network access and even has a regular expression engine that protects against exhaustion attacks (provided you configure a time limit).</li>\n<li>Claude span up and tested a Python library that calls a MicroQuickJS shared library (involving a little bit of extra C), a compiled a Python binding and a library that uses the original MicroQuickJS CLI tool. All of those approaches work well.</li>\n<li>Compiling to WebAssembly was a little harder. It got a version working in Node.js and Deno and Pyodide, but the Python libraries wasmer and wasmtime proved harder, apparently because \"mquickjs uses setjmp/longjmp for error handling\". It managed to get to a working wasmtime version with <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/mquickjs-sandbox/README.md#working-solution\">a gross hack</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm really excited about this. MicroQuickJS is tiny, full featured, looks robust and comes from excellent pedigree. I think this makes for a very solid new entrant in the quest for a robust sandbox.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: I had Claude Code build <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/microquickjs\">tools.simonwillison.net/microquickjs</a>, an interactive web playground for trying out the WebAssembly build of MicroQuickJS, adapted from my previous <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/quickjs\">QuickJS plaground</a>.

      "content": "\n    <p>I've been having an absurd amount of fun recently using LLMs for cooking. I started out using them for basic recipes, but as I've grown more confident in their culinary abilities I've leaned into them for more advanced tasks. Today I tried something new: having Claude vibe-code up a custom application to help with the timing for a complicated meal preparation. It worked really well!</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"a-custom-timing-app-for-two-recipes-at-once\">A custom timing app for two recipes at once</h4>\r\n<p>We have family staying at the moment, which means cooking for four. We subscribe to a meal delivery service called <a href=\"https://www.greenchef.com/\">Green Chef</a>, mainly because it takes the thinking out of cooking three times a week: grab a bag from the fridge, follow the instructions, eat.</p>\r\n<p>Each bag serves two portions, so cooking for four means preparing two bags at once.</p>\r\n<p>I have done this a few times now and it is always a mad flurry of pans and ingredients and timers and desperately trying to figure out what should happen when and how to get both recipes finished at the same time. It's fun but it's also chaotic and error-prone.</p>\r\n<p>This time I decided to try something different, and potentially even more chaotic and error-prone: I outsourced the planning entirely to Claude.</p>\r\n<p>I took this single photo of the two recipe cards side-by-side and fed it to Claude Opus 4.5 (in the Claude iPhone app) with this prompt:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Extract both of these recipes in as much detail as possible</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/recipe-cards.jpg\" alt=\"Two recipe cards placed next to each other on a kitchen counter. Each card has detailed instructions plus photographs of steps.\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" /></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>This is a moderately challenging vision task in that there quite a lot of small text in the photo. I wasn't confident Opus could handle it.</p>\r\n<p>I hadn't read the recipe cards myself. The responsible thing to do here would be a thorough review or at least a spot-check - I chose to keep things chaotic and didn't do any more than quickly eyeball the result.</p>\r\n<p>I asked what pots I'd need:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Give me a full list of pots I would need if I was cooking both of them at once</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Then I prompted it to build a custom application to help me with the cooking process itself:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I am going to cook them both at the same time. Build me a no react, mobile, friendly, interactive, artifact that spells out the process with exact timing on when everything needs to happen have a start setting at the top, which starts a timer and persists when I hit start in localStorage in case the page reloads. The next steps should show prominently with countdowns to when they open. The full combined timeline should be shown slow with calculated times tor when each thing should happen</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I copied the result out onto my own hosting (<a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/blackened-cauliflower-and-turkish-style-stew\">you can try it here</a>) because I wasn't sure if localStorage would work inside the Claude app and I <em>really</em> didn't want it to forget my times!</p>\r\n<p>Then I clicked \"start cooking\"!</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/recipe-timer.gif\" alt=\"The recipe app shows a full timeline with 00:00 Preheat Oven and onwards, plus a big Start Cooking button. In the animation clicking the button starts a timer clicking up, adds a Do this now panel showing the Start all prep work step, shows Coming Up Next with timers counting down to the next steps and updates the full timeline to show local clock times where it previously showed durations from 00:00 upwards.\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" /></p>\r\n<p>Here's the <a href=\"https://claude.ai/share/4acab994-c22b-4ddf-81bd-2f22d947c521\">full Claude transcript</a>.</p>\r\n<p>There was just one notable catch: our dog, Cleo, knows <em>exactly</em> when her dinner time is, at 6pm sharp. I forgot to mention this to Claude, which had scheduled several key steps colliding with Cleo's meal. I got woofed at. I deserved it.</p>\r\n<p>To my great surprise, <em>it worked</em>. I followed the recipe guide to the minute and served up both meals exactly 44 minutes after I started cooking.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/recipe-finished.jpg\" alt=\"A small bowl (a beautiful blue sea textured bowl, made by Natalie Downe) contains a chickpea stew. A larger black bowl has couscous, green beans and blackened cauliflower.\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" /></p>\r\n<p>The best way to learn the capabilities of LLMs is to throw tasks at them that may be beyond their abilities and see what happens. In this case I fully expected that something would get forgotten or a detail would be hallucinated and I'd end up scrambling to fix things half way through the process. I was surprised and impressed that it worked so well.</p>\r\n<p>Some credit for the app idea should go to my fellow hackers at <a href=\"https://devfort.com/fort/2/\">/dev/fort 2 in 2009</a>, when we rented Knockbrex Castle in Dumfries, Scotland for a week and attempted to build a cooking timer application for complex meals.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"generating-recipes-from-scratch\">Generating recipes from scratch</h4>\r\n<p>Most of my other cooking experiments with LLMs have been a whole lot simpler than this: I ask for a recipe, ask for some variations and then cook one of them and see what happens.</p>\r\n<p>This works remarkably well considering LLMs have no taste buds.</p>\r\n<p>I've started to think of this as asking LLMs for the <em>average</em> recipe for a dish, based on all of the recipes they have hoovered up during their training. It turns out the mean version of every guacamole recipe on the internet is a decent guacamole!</p>\r\n<p>Here's an example of a recipe I tried recently that worked out really well. I was helping Natalie run her ceramic stall at the farmers market and the stall next to us sold excellent dried beans. I've never used dried beans before, so I took a photo of their selection and asked Claude what I could do with them:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/beans-1.jpg\" alt=\"Several bags of tasty looking beans of different varieties and colors\" style=\"width: 48%;\" /> <img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/beans-2.jpg\" alt=\"More bags of beans.\" style=\"width: 48%;\" /></p>\r\n<p>Identify these beans</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>It took a guess at the beans, then I said:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Get me excited about cooking with these! If I bought two varietiew what could I make</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\"Get me excited\" switches Claude into a sort of hype-man mode, which is kind of entertaining:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Oh, you're about to enter the <em>wonderful</em> world of bean cooking! Let me get you pumped about some killer two-bean combos: [...]</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mixed bean salad</strong> with lemon, olive oil, fresh herbs, cherry tomatoes - light but satisfying [...]</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I replied:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>OK Bean salad has me interested - these are dried beans. Give me some salad options I can make that would last a long time in the fridge</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>... and after some back and forth we arrived on the <a href=\"https://claude.ai/share/c7534766-22d8-481b-bd80-a21abc53f5b2\">recipe in this transcript</a>, which I cooked the following day (asking plenty of follow-up questions) and thoroughly enjoyed.</p>\r\n<p>I've done this a bunch of times with a bunch of different recipes across both Claude and ChatGPT and honestly I've not had a notable miss yet. Being able to say \"make it vegan\" or \"I don't have coriander, what can I use instead?\" or just \"make it tastier\" is a really fun way to explore cooking.</p>\r\n<p>It's also fun to repeat \"make it tastier\" multiple times to see how absurd you can get.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"i-really-want-someone-to-turn-this-into-a-benchmark-\">I really want someone to turn this into a benchmark!</h4>\r\n<p>Cooking with LLMs is a lot of fun. There's an opportunity here for a <em>really</em> neat benchmark: take a bunch of leading models, prompt them for recipes, follow those recipes and taste-test the results!</p>\r\n<p>The logistics of running this are definitely too much for me to handle myself. I have enough trouble cooking two meals at once, for a solid benchmark you'd ideally have several models serving meals up at the same time to a panel of tasters.</p>\r\n<p>If someone else wants to try this please let me know how it goes!</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/cooking\">cooking</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/devfort\">devfort</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/tools\">tools</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/anthropic\">anthropic</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude\">claude</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/vision-llms\">vision-llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/vibe-coding\">vibe-coding</a></p>\n    \n\n",

      "content": "\n    <p>In all of the debates about the value of AI-assistance in software development there's one depressing anecdote that I keep on seeing: the junior engineer, empowered by some class of LLM tool, who deposits giant, untested PRs on their coworkers - or open source maintainers - and expects the \"code review\" process to handle the rest.</p>\r\n<p>This is rude, a waste of other people's time, and is honestly a dereliction of duty as a software developer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work.</strong></p>\r\n<p>As software engineers we don't just crank out code - in fact these days you could argue that's what the LLMs are for. We need to deliver <em>code that works</em> - and we need to include <em>proof</em> that it works as well.  Not doing that directly shifts the burden of the actual work to whoever is expected to review our code.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"how-to-prove-it-works\">How to prove it works</h4>\r\n<p>There are two steps to proving a piece of code works. Neither is optional.</p>\r\n<p>The first is <strong>manual testing</strong>. If you haven't seen the code do the right thing yourself, that code doesn't work. If it does turn out to work, that's honestly just pure chance.</p>\r\n<p>Manual testing skills are genuine skills that you need to develop. You need to be able to get the system into an initial state that demonstrates your change, then exercise the change, then check and demonstrate that it has the desired effect.</p>\r\n<p>If possible I like to reduce these steps to a sequence of terminal commands which I can paste, along with their output, into a comment in the code review. Here's a <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/issues/116#issuecomment-3666551798\">recent example</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Some changes are harder to demonstrate. It's still your job to demonstrate them! Record a screen capture video and add that to the PR. Show your reviewers that the change you made actually works.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've tested the happy path where everything works you can start trying the edge cases. Manual testing is a skill, and finding the things that break is the next level of that skill that helps define a senior engineer.</p>\r\n<p>The second step in proving a change works is <strong>automated testing</strong>. This is so much easier now that we have LLM tooling, which means there's no excuse at all for skipping this step.</p>\r\n<p>Your contribution should <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/\">bundle the change</a> with an automated test that proves the change works. That test should fail if you revert the implementation.</p>\r\n<p>The process for writing a test mirrors that of manual testing: get the system into an initial known state, exercise the change, assert that it worked correctly. Integrating a test harness to productively facilitate this is another key skill worth investing in.</p>\r\n<p>Don't be tempted to skip the manual test because you think the automated test has you covered already! Almost every time I've done this myself I've quickly regretted it.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"make-your-coding-agent-prove-it-first\">Make your coding agent prove it first</h4>\r\n<p>The most important trend in LLMs in 2025 has been the explosive growth of <strong>coding agents</strong> - tools like Claude Code and Codex CLI that can actively execute the code they are working on to check that it works and further iterate on any problems.</p>\r\n<p>To master these tools you need to learn how to get them to <em>prove their changes work</em> as well.</p>\r\n<p>This looks exactly the same as the process I described above: they need to be able to manually test their changes as they work, and they need to be able to build automated tests that guarantee the change will continue to work in the future.</p>\r\n<p>Since they're robots, automated tests and manual tests are effectively the same thing.</p>\r\n<p>They do feel a little different though. When I'm working on CLI tools I'll usually teach Claude Code how to run them itself so it can do one-off tests, even though the eventual automated tests will use a system like <a href=\"https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/testing/\">Click's CLIRunner</a>.</p>\r\n<p>When working on CSS changes I'll often encourage my coding agent to take screenshots when it needs to check if the change it made had the desired effect.</p>\r\n<p>The good news about automated tests is that coding agents need very little encouragement to write them. If your project has tests already most agents will extend that test suite without you even telling them to do so. They'll also reuse patterns from existing tests, so keeping your test code well organized and populated with patterns you like is a great way to help your agent build testing code to your taste.</p>\r\n<p>Developing good taste in testing code is another of those skills that differentiates a senior engineer.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"the-human-provides-the-accountability\">The human provides the accountability</h4>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/3/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable/\">A computer can never be held accountable</a>. That's your job as the human in the loop.</p>\r\n<p>Almost anyone can prompt an LLM to generate a thousand-line patch and submit it for code review. That's no longer valuable. What's valuable is contributing <em>code that is proven to work</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Next time you submit a PR, make sure you've included your evidence that it works as it should.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/programming\">programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/careers\">careers</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/vibe-coding\">vibe-coding</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a></p>\n    \n\n",

I definitely did <em>some</em> editing by hand, and a fair bit of prompting that resulted in targeted code edits, but the vast amount of architectural logic came from JustHTML. So I opted to make the <a href=\"https://tangled.org/anil.recoil.org/ocaml-html5rw/blob/main/LICENSE.md\">LICENSE a joint one</a> with <a href=\"https://friendlybit.com\">Emil Stenström</a>. I did not follow the transitive dependency through to the Rust one, which I probably should.</p>\n<p>I'm also extremely uncertain about every releasing this library to the central opam repository, especially as there are <a href=\"https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup\">excellent HTML5 parsers</a> already available. I haven't checked if those pass the HTML5 test suite, because this is wandering into the agents <em>vs</em> humans territory that I ruled out in my <a href=\"https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025#groundrules-for-the-advent-of-agentic-humps\">groundrules</a>. Whether or not this agentic code is better or not is a moot point if releasing it drives away the human maintainers who are the source of creativity in the code!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I decided to <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commit/106289acee29045cc5afe9732915357063dfc37a\">credit Emil in the same way</a> for my own vibespiled project.\n\n    <p><small></small>Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/avsm/status/2000979482744607216\">@avsm</a></small></p>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/definitions\">definitions</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/functional-programming\">functional-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/vibe-coding\">vibe-coding</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ocaml\">ocaml</a></p>\n\n\n\n",

Today's big news is <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/developers/build-with-gemini-3-flash/\">Gemini 3 Flash</a>, the latest in Google's \"Flash\" line of faster and less expensive models.</p>\r\n<p>Google are emphasizing the comparison between the new Flash and their previous generation's top model Gemini 2.5 Pro:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Building on 3 Pro’s strong multimodal, coding and agentic features, 3 Flash offers powerful performance at less than a quarter the cost of 3 Pro, along with higher rate limits. The new 3 Flash model surpasses 2.5 Pro across many benchmarks while delivering faster speeds.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Gemini 3 Flash's characteristics are almost identical to Gemini 3 Pro: it accepts text, image, video, audio, and PDF, outputs only text, handles 1,048,576 maximum input tokens and up to 65,536 output tokens, and has the same knowledge cut-off date of January 2025 (also shared with the Gemini 2.5 series).</p>\r\n<p>The benchmarks look good. The cost is appealing: 1/4 the price of Gemini 3 Pro ≤200k and 1/8 the price of Gemini 3 Pro &gt;200k, and it's nice not to have a price increase for the new Flash at larger token lengths.</p>\r\n<p>It's a little <em>more</em> expensive than previous Flash models - Gemini 2.5 Flash was $0.30/million input tokens and $2.50/million on output, Gemini 3 Flash is $0.50/million and $3/million respectively.</p>\r\n<p>Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-flash/\">claim</a> it may still end up cheaper though, due to more efficient output token usage:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>> Gemini 3 Flash is able to modulate how much it thinks. It may think longer for more complex use cases, but it also uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=100000&amp;ot=10000&amp;sel=gemini-3-flash-preview%2Cgemini-3-pro-preview%2Cgemini-3-pro-preview-200k%2Cgpt-5.2%2Cclaude-opus-4-5%2Cclaude-sonnet-4.5%2Cclaude-4.5-haiku%2Cgemini-2.5-flash%2Cgpt-5-mini\">a more extensive price comparison</a> on my <a href=\"https://www.llm-prices.com/\">llm-prices.com</a> site.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"generating-some-svgs-of-pelicans\">Generating some SVGs of pelicans</h4>\r\n<p>I released <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.28\">llm-gemini 0.28</a> this morning with support for the new model. You can try it out like this:</p>\r\n<pre><code>llm install -U llm-gemini\r\nllm keys set gemini # paste in key\r\nllm -m gemini-3-flash-preview \"Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle\"\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3#thinking_level\">the developer docs</a> the new model supports four different thinking level options: <code>minimal</code>, <code>low</code>, <code>medium</code>, and <code>high</code>. This is different from Gemini 3 Pro, which only supported <code>low</code> and <code>high</code>.</p>\r\n<p>You can run those like this:</p>\r\n<pre><code>llm -m gemini-3-flash-preview --thinking-level minimal \"Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle\"\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>Here are four pelicans, for thinking levels <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/8047c805a4a1df7fd4e854b18e7482d9\">minimal</a>, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/fb61686a1f915e3777b4a40e2df41068\">low</a>, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/190c3ce82cd8976827139bbc4dcc2d19\">medium</a>, and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/da66ffce135359161996e41e50e32ec3\">high</a>:</p>\r\n<image-gallery width=\"4\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-flash-preview-thinking-level-minimal-pelican-svg.jpg\" alt=\"A minimalist vector illustration of a stylized white bird with a long orange beak and a red cap riding a dark blue bicycle on a single grey ground line against a plain white background.\" />\r\n    <img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-flash-preview-thinking-level-low-pelican-svg.jpg\" alt=\"Minimalist illustration: A stylized white bird with a large, wedge-shaped orange beak and a single black dot for an eye rides a red bicycle with black wheels and a yellow pedal against a solid light blue background.\" />\r\n    <img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-flash-preview-thinking-level-medium-pelican-svg.jpg\" alt=\"A minimalist illustration of a stylized white bird with a large yellow beak riding a red road bicycle in a racing position on a light blue background.\" />\r\n    <img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-flash-preview-thinking-level-high-pelican-svg.jpg\" alt=\"Minimalist line-art illustration of a stylized white bird with a large orange beak riding a simple black bicycle with one orange pedal, centered against a light blue circular background.\" />\r\n</image-gallery>\r\n<h4 id=\"i-built-the-gallery-component-with-gemini-3-flash\">I built the gallery component with Gemini 3 Flash</h4>\r\n<p>The gallery above uses a new Web Component which I built using Gemini 3 Flash to try out its coding abilities.

It also takes a required --refresh-interval option which can be set as 5m or 10h or 30s. All this thing does is reply on / to a GET request with the IAM expiring credentials that allow access to that bucket with that policy for that specified amount of time. It caches internally the credentials it generates and will return the exact same data up until they expire (it also tracks expected expiry time) after which it will generate new credentials (avoiding dog pile effects if multiple requests ask at the same time) and return and cache those instead.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/aws\">aws</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/projects\">projects</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/s3\">s3</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-release-notes\">annotated-release-notes</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/s3-credentials\">s3-credentials</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-engineering\">prompt-engineering</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code\">claude-code</a></p>\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "\n    <p>I <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/justhtml/\">wrote about JustHTML yesterday</a> - Emil Stenström's project to build a new standards compliant HTML5 parser in pure Python code using coding agents running against the comprehensive html5lib-tests testing library. Last night, purely out of curiosity, I decided to try <strong>porting JustHTML from Python to JavaScript</strong> with the least amount of effort possible, using Codex CLI and GPT-5.2. It worked beyond my expectations.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"tl-dr\">TL;DR</h4>\r\n<p>I built <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml\">simonw/justjshtml</a>, a dependency-free HTML5 parsing library in JavaScript which passes 9,200 tests from the html5lib-tests suite and imitates the API design of Emil's JustHTML library.</p>\r\n<p>It took two initial prompts and a few tiny follow-ups. <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/11/gpt-52/\">GPT-5.2</a> running in <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/codex\">Codex CLI</a> ran uninterrupted for several hours, burned through 1,464,295 input tokens, 97,122,176 cached input tokens and 625,563 output tokens and ended up producing 9,000 lines of fully tested JavaScript across 43 commits.</p>\r\n<p>Time elapsed from project idea to finished library: about 4 hours, during which I also bought and decorated a Christmas tree with family and watched the latest Knives Out movie.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"some-background\">Some background</h4>\r\n<p>One of the most important contributions of the HTML5 specification ten years ago was the way it precisely specified how <em>invalid</em> HTML should be parsed. The world is full of invalid documents and having a specification that covers those means browsers can treat them in the same way - there's no more \"undefined behavior\" to worry about when building parsing software.</p>\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly, those invalid parsing rules are pretty complex! The free online book <a href=\"https://htmlparser.info/\">Idiosyncrasies of the HTML parser</a> by Simon Pieters is an excellent deep dive into this topic, in particular <a href=\"https://htmlparser.info/parser/\">Chapter 3. The HTML parser</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The Python <a href=\"https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python\">html5lib</a> project started the <a href=\"https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests\">html5lib-tests</a> repository with a set of implementation-independent tests. These have since become the gold standard for interoperability testing of HTML5 parsers, and are used by projects such as <a href=\"https://github.com/servo/servo\">Servo</a> which used them to help build <a href=\"https://github.com/servo/html5ever\">html5ever</a>, a \"high-performance browser-grade HTML5 parser\" written in Rust.</p>\r\n<p>Emil Stenström's <a href=\"https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml\">JustHTML</a> project is a pure-Python implementation of an HTML5 parser that passes the full html5lib-tests suite. Emil <a href=\"https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/\">spent a couple of months</a> working on this as a side project, deliberately picking a problem with a comprehensive existing test suite to see how far he could get with coding agents.</p>\r\n<p>At one point he had the agents rewrite it based on a close inspection of the Rust html5ever library. I don't know how much of this was direct translation versus inspiration (here's Emil's <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264195#46267059\">commentary on that</a>) - his project has 1,215 commits total so it appears to have included a huge amount of iteration, not just a straight port.</p>\r\n<p>My project <strong>is</strong> a straight port. I instructed Codex CLI to build a JavaScript version of Emil's Python code.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"the-process-in-detail\">The process in detail</h4>\r\n<p>I started with a bit of mise en place. I checked out two repos and created an empty third directory for the new project:</p>\r\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c1\">cd</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">~</span>/dev\r\ngit clone https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml\r\ngit clone https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests\r\nmkdir justjshtml\r\n<span class=\"pl-c1\">cd</span> justjshtml</pre></div>\r\n<p>Then I started Codex CLI for GPT-5.2 like this:</p>\r\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>codex --yolo -m gpt-5.2</pre></div>\r\n<p>That <code>--yolo</code> flag is a shortcut for <code>--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox</code>, which is every bit as dangerous as it sounds.</p>\r\n<p>My first prompt told Codex to inspect the existing code and use it to build a specification for the new JavaScript library:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><code>We are going to create a JavaScript port of ~/dev/justhtml - an HTML parsing library that passes the full ~/dev/html5lib-tests test suite. It is going to have a similar API to the Python library but in JavaScript. It will have no dependencies other than raw JavaScript, hence it will work great in the browser and node.js and other environments. Start by reading ~/dev/justhtml and designing the user-facing API for the new library - create a spec.md containing your plan.</code></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I reviewed the spec, which included a set of proposed milestones, and told it to add another:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><code>Add an early step to the roadmap that involves an initial version that parses a simple example document that is valid and returns the right results. Then add and commit the spec.md file.</code></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/blob/19b8eb1f2ca80f428a3c40862d5ec05d36e5166b/spec.md\">the resulting spec.md file</a>. My request for that initial version became \"Milestone 0.5\" which looked like this:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Milestone 0.5 — End-to-end smoke parse (single valid document)</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Implement the smallest end-to-end slice so the public API is real early:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<code>new JustHTML(\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\")</code> returns a tree with the expected tag structure and text nodes.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<code>doc.toText()</code> returns <code>\"Hello\"</code> and <code>doc.errors</code> is empty for this valid input.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Add <code>scripts/smoke.js</code> (no deps) that runs the example and asserts the expected structure/output.</li>\r\n<li>Gate: <code>node scripts/smoke.js</code> passes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Then I told it:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><code>Implement Milestone 0.5</code></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>And off it went. The resulting code appeared to work so I said:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><code>Configure GitHub Actions test.yml to run that on every commit, then commit and push</code></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I ran <code>git init</code> and created a private GitHub repository for this project at this point, and set up the local directory to push to that remote.</p>\r\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commit/48497cbd05584c88af757a0736a2ee447468b6b3\">that initial push</a>. Then I told it:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><code>OK do the rest, commit and push often</code></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>And that was almost it!</p>\r\n<p>I set my laptop to not fall asleep and left it to its devices while we went off to buy a Christmas tree. The \"commit and push often\" meant I could monitor its progress on my phone by refreshing <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commits/main\">the commit log on GitHub</a>.</p>\r\n<p>I was running this against my $20/month ChatGPT Plus account, which has a five hour token allowance window for Codex CLI. That ran out at 6:35pm and Codex paused, so I waited until the reset point at 7:14pm and typed:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><code>Keep going</code></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>At 9:30pm it declared itself done with the following summary message:</p>\r\n<pre><code>• What’s Done\r\n\r\n  - html5lib-tests now run in CI and pass: tokenizer 6810/6810, tree 1770/1782\r\n    (12 skipped: #script-on), serializer 230/230, encoding 82/83 (1 skipped:\r\n    scripted) (.github/workflows/test.yml:1).\r\n  - Public API expanded: stream() (src/stream.js:1), CSS selectors query()/\r\n    matches() (src/selector.js:1), and toMarkdown() (src/markdown.js:1), all\r\n    exported via src/index.js:1.\r\n  - Added no-deps unit scripts for selectors/stream/markdown (scripts/run-\r\n    selector-tests.js:1, scripts/run-stream-tests.js:1, scripts/run-markdown-\r\n    tests.js:1) and wired them into CI.\r\n  - Fixed TreeBuilder so &lt;br&gt; no longer closes &lt;p&gt; (src/treebuilder.js:647).\r\n</code></pre>\r\n<p>As a finishing touch, I had it add a playground interface so I could try out the new library in my browser. I prompted:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><code>Add a playground.html in the top level folder which loads the necessary ES modules from ./src/... and implements the exact same functionality as seen on https://tools.simonwillison.net/justhtml but using the JavaScript library instead of Pyodide</code></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>It fetched my <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/justhtml\">existing JustHTML playground page</a> (<a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/justhtml/#first-impressions-of-justhtml\">described here</a>) using <code>curl</code> and built a new <code>playground.html</code> file that loaded the new JavaScript code instead. This worked <em>perfectly</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enabled GitHub Pages for my still-private repo which meant I could access the new playground at this URL:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://simonw.github.io/justjshtml/playground.html\">https://simonw.github.io/justjshtml/playground.html</a></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/justjshtml-playground.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of JustJSHTML Playground web application.

I used GPT-5.2 for this but I have no reason to believe that Claude Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 Pro would not be able to achieve the same thing - the only reason I haven't tried is that I don't want to burn another 4 hours of time and several million tokens on more runs.</li>\r\n<li>If you can reduce a problem to a robust test suite you can set a coding agent loop loose on it with a high degree of confidence that it will eventually succeed. I called this <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/\">designing the agentic loop</a> a few months ago. I think it's the key skill to unlocking the potential of LLMs for complex tasks.</li>\r\n<li>Porting entire open source libraries from one language to another via a coding agent works extremely well.</li>\r\n<li>Code is so cheap it's practically free. Code that <em>works</em> continues to carry a cost, but that cost has plummeted now that coding agents can check their work as they go.</li>\r\n<li>We haven't even <em>begun</em> to unpack the etiquette and ethics around this style of development. Is it responsible and appropriate to churn out a direct port of a library like this in a few hours while watching a movie? What would it take for code built like this to be trusted in production?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I'll end with some open questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Does this library represent a legal violation of copyright of either the Rust library or the Python one?</li>\r\n<li>Even if this is legal, is it ethical to build a library in this way?</li>\r\n<li>Does this format of development hurt the open source ecosystem?</li>\r\n<li>Can I even assert copyright over this, given how much of the work was produced by the LLM?</li>\r\n<li>Is it responsible to publish software libraries built in this way?</li>\r\n<li>How much better would this library be if an expert team hand crafted it over the course of several months?</li>\r\n</ul>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/html\">html</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/javascript\">javascript</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/python\">python</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/gpt-5\">gpt-5</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/codex-cli\">codex-cli</a></p>\n    \n\n",

      "content": "\n    <p>I recently came across <a href=\"https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml\">JustHTML</a>, a new Python library for parsing HTML released by Emil Stenström. It's a very interesting piece of software, both as a useful library and as a case study in sophisticated AI-assisted programming.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"first-impressions-of-justhtml\">First impressions of JustHTML</h4>\r\n<p>I didn't initially know that JustHTML had been written with AI assistance at all. The README caught my eye due to some attractive characteristics:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It's pure Python. I like libraries that are pure Python (no C extensions or similar) because it makes them easy to use in less conventional Python environments, including Pyodide.</li>\r\n<li>\"Passes all 9,200+ tests in the official <a href=\"https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests\">html5lib-tests</a> suite (used by browser vendors)\" - this instantly caught my attention! HTML5 is a big, complicated but meticulously written specification.</li>\r\n<li>100% test coverage. That's not something you see every day.</li>\r\n<li>CSS selector queries as a feature. I built a Python library for this <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/soupselect\">many years ago</a> and I'm always interested in seeing new implementations of that pattern.</li>\r\n<li>html5lib has been <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues/698\">inconsistently maintained</a> over the last few years, leaving me interested in potential alternatives.</li>\r\n<li>It's only 3,000 lines of implementation code (and another ~11,000 of tests.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I was out and about without a laptop so I decided to put JustHTML through its paces on my phone. I <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/156#issue-3726212220\">prompted Claude Code for web</a> on my phone and had it build <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/justhtml\">this Pyodide-powered HTML tool</a> for trying it out:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 1em\"><img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/justhtml.jpeg\" style=\"width:80%;\" alt=\"Screenshot of a web app interface titled &quot;Playground Mode&quot; with buttons labeled &quot;CSS Selector Query&quot; (purple, selected), &quot;Pretty Print HTML&quot;, &quot;Tree Structure&quot;, &quot;Stream Events&quot;, &quot;Extract Text&quot;, and &quot;To Markdown&quot; (all gray). Below is a text field labeled &quot;CSS Selector:&quot; containing &quot;p&quot; and a green &quot;Run Query&quot; button. An &quot;Output&quot; section with dark background shows 3 matches in a green badge and displays HTML code\" /></p>\r\n<p>This was enough for me to convince myself that the core functionality worked as advertised. It's a neat piece of code!</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"turns-out-it-was-almost-all-built-by-llms\">Turns out it was almost all built by LLMs</h4>\r\n<p>At this point I went looking for some more background information on the library and found Emil's blog entry about it: <a href=\"https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/\">How I wrote JustHTML using coding agents</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Writing a full HTML5 parser is not a short one-shot problem. I have been working on this project for a couple of months on off-hours.</p>\r\n<p>Tooling: I used plain VS Code with Github Copilot in Agent mode. I enabled automatic approval of all commands, and then added a blacklist of commands that I always wanted to approve manually. I wrote an <a href=\"https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/blob/main/.github/copilot-instructions.md\">agent instruction</a> that told it to keep working, and don't stop to ask questions. Worked well!</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Emil used several different models - an advantage of working in VS Code Agent mode rather than a provider-locked coding agent like Claude Code or Codex CLI. Claude Sonnet 3.7, Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Opus all get a mention.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"vibe-engineering-not-vibe-coding\">Vibe engineering, not vibe coding</h4>\r\n<p>What's most interesting about Emil's 17 step account covering those several months of work is how much software engineering was involved, independent of typing out the actual code.</p>\r\n<p>I wrote about <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/\">vibe engineering</a> a while ago as an alternative to vibe coding.</p>\r\n<p>Vibe coding is when you have an LLM knock out code without any semblance of code review - great for prototypes and toy projects, definitely not an approach to use for serious libraries or production code.</p>\r\n<p>I proposed \"vibe engineering\" as the grown up version of vibe coding, where expert programmers use coding agents in a professional and responsible way to produce high quality, reliable results.</p>\r\n<p>You should absolutely read <a href=\"https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/#the-journey\">Emil's account</a> in full. A few highlights:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>He hooked in the 9,200 test <a href=\"https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests\">html5lib-tests</a> conformance suite almost from the start. There's no better way to construct a new HTML5 parser than using the test suite that the browsers themselves use.</li>\r\n<li>He picked the core API design himself - a TagHandler base class with handle_start() etc. methods - and told the model to implement that.</li>\r\n<li>He added a comparative benchmark to track performance compared to existing libraries like html5lib, then experimented with a Rust optimization based on those initial numbers.</li>\r\n<li>He threw the original code away and started from scratch as a rough port of Servo's excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/servo/html5ever\">html5ever</a> Rust library.</li>\r\n<li>He built a custom profiler and new benchmark and let Gemini 3 Pro loose on it, finally achieving micro-optimizations to beat the existing Pure Python libraries.</li>\r\n<li>He used coverage to identify and remove unnecessary code.</li>\r\n<li>He had his agent build a <a href=\"https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/blob/main/benchmarks/fuzz.py\">custom fuzzer</a> to generate vast numbers of invalid HTML documents and harden the parser against them.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>This represents a lot of sophisticated development practices, tapping into Emil's deep experience as a software engineer. As described, this feels to me more like a lead architect role than a hands-on coder.</p>\r\n<p>It perfectly fits what I was thinking about when I described <strong>vibe engineering</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Setting the coding agent up with the html5lib-tests suite is also a great example of <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/\">designing an agentic loop</a>.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"-the-agent-did-the-typing-\">\"The agent did the typing\"</h4>\r\n<p>Emil concluded his article like this:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>JustHTML is about 3,000 lines of Python with 8,500+ tests passing. I couldn't have written it this quickly without the agent.</p>\r\n<p>But \"quickly\" doesn't mean \"without thinking.\" I spent a lot of time reviewing code, making design decisions, and steering the agent in the right direction. The agent did the typing; I did the thinking.</p>\r\n<p>That's probably the right division of labor.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I couldn't agree more. Coding agents replace the part of my job that involves typing the code into a computer. I find what's left to be a much more valuable use of my time.</p>\n    \n        <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/html\">html</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/python\">python</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/generative-ai\">generative-ai</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/llms\">llms</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming\">ai-assisted-programming</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/vibe-coding\">vibe-coding</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/coding-agents\">coding-agents</a></p>\n    \n\n",
